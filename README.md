The first project that got me going after finishing the udemy course [Machine Learning from A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning/)

Although I have picked the intuition from the course much of the stuff is from researching such as;

* Outlier removal.
* Custom [categorical encoder library from github.](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/categorical-encoding)
* Usage of XGBoost.
* GA based parameter search.

There is a single notebook. Enjoy!
